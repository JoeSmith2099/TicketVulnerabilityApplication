The program works by the server setting up the text files that store events and users initially. Once these are setup, the server will send a message saying that the data has been set up. On the client side, the client will be prompted with a menu of options. The user can then input which option they would like to choose and will be prompted with the proper instructions for the respected option. The menu stays in a continuous loop so that the user can do whatever they need to do. Then, if the user would like to exit the program, they simply type “9”  to exit.
